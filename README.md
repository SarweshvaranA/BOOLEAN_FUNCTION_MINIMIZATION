# EXPNO:2 IMPLEMENTATION OF BOOLEAN FUNCTION

**AIM:**

To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.

F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D 

F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy

**Equipment Required:**

Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher

**Software – Quartus prime**

**Theory**

In digital electronics, Boolean functions are used to represent logical operations using variables and logic gates. These functions can be implemented using Verilog, a hardware description language (HDL), and simulated using software like Quartus Prime.

In this experiment, two Boolean functions (F1 and F2) are implemented:

F1 = A’B’C’D’ + AC’D’ + B’CD’ + A’BCD + BC’D
This is a 4-variable Boolean expression.

The variables used are A, B, C, and D.

The function is implemented using basic logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT.

F2 = xy’z + x’y’z + w’xy + wx’y + wxy
This is another Boolean function with 4 variables: w, x, y, and z.

It is implemented similarly using logic gates.



**Procedure**

1.	Type the program in Quartus software.

2.	Compile and run the program.

3.	Generate the RTL schematic and save the logic diagram.

4.	Create nodes for inputs and outputs to generate the timing diagram.

5.	For different input combinations generate the timing diagram.
